## BI-PSI

Students understand the basic common techniques, protocols, technologies, and algorithms necessary to communicate in computer networks focusing primarily the 2nd to 4th layer of the ISO OSI model. They also get a basic understanding of communication media, security, and network administration. Students will be able to write a simple network application and configure a simple network.

## BI-TPS

The course introduces students with basic and advanced technologies, components, and interfaces of contemporary computer networks at the physical layer with the overlap to the link layer. The lectures provide theoretical foundations of these technologies and explain relevant physical principles. In the labs, the respective technologies will be demonstrated and with the most important ones students will get hands-on experience. Thematically, the course covers both local and long-range optical networks, Ethernet, modern wireless networks, always with focus on high-speed networks.

## Basic Python and Data Science

Data science is the field of extracting information from data using scientific methods, statistics and algorithms. It is used in a number of fields, such as economics, informatics, medicine, etc. The course guides participants through the basics of Python programming, data collection and storage, data visualization and analysis. As part of data analysis, statistical analysis, machine learning and time series analysis will be demonstrated. The course will prepare students to obtain the PCAP cisco certification, which is part of this course. Graduates of the course will be prepared for the basic use of Python, will be introduced to data science issues, and will be prepared to use Python for data analysis.
