At the stunning Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, a place that hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics and soon the 2026 games, my colleagues and I led a workshop during the [winter PhD school NECS 2024](https://necs-winterschool.disi.unitn.it/). The workshop was attended by approx. 15 people, mostly PhD students and researchers.

We split our session into two parts. Initially, we introduced the basics of data analysis, exploring the explorative data analysis in pandas, distribution estimation, and more. In the second part, we discussed and practiced the topic of network traffic classification in general and the possibilities of using AI in this area. The workshop was very successful, and we are planning to organize a similar workshop soon. An important part of the workshop was the introduction of [`cesnet-datazoo`](https://cesnet.github.io/cesnet-datazoo/), a python package for easy access to network traffic datasets ([Github](https://github.com/CESNET/cesnet-datazoo)).

For those who missed it, worry not. The workshop is free for all, and we've made all materials accessible on [our shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/10ECESlazevBJ4L6UhOpaC7l7SpKifS02).

Thanks to all the participants, and I hope to see you next time! BTW, Cortina is a beautiful place.
