On June 15, 2024, as a president of IEEE student branch for CTU I coorganize the **Cybersecurity Summer School** event which took place at the Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU). This initiative aimed to enhance cybersecurity awareness and skills among students and professionals. The event was organized by the **Center for Cybersecurity** in collaboration with IEEE student branch for CTU.

## Event Highlights

- **Keynote Presentations**: Experts from academia and industry shared insights into the latest cybersecurity trends, challenges, and best practices.

- **Hands-on Workshops**: Participants engaged in practical sessions focusing on network security, ethical hacking, and incident response.

- **Panel Discussions**: Thought leaders discussed the future of cybersecurity education and the importance of continuous learning in this rapidly evolving field.

## My Contribution

As a co-organizer and presenter at the event, I had the opportunity to:

- **Deliver a Presentation**: I shared presentation on Scapy - A Tool to Manipulate with Packets. The Scapy is a powerful Python-based tool for network packet manipulation, generation, and analysis. It is widely used by network engineers, security researchers, and penetration testers due to its flexibility and ability to interact with network packets at a low level.

- **Facilitate a Workshop**: I led a session on using Machine Learning in Network Traffic Classification and how to avoid common pitfals, providing participants with practical skills and knowledge.

## Impact and Feedback

The event successfully brought together students, educators, and industry professionals to foster a collaborative learning environment. Participants appreciated the blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application, emphasizing the importance of such initiatives in bridging the gap between academia and industry.
